# CGeNArate docker web services

In this repository there are all the files needed for executing the different **CGeNArate** services: **website, workflow and SGE**. All these services have been integrated into **containers** and connected between them via docker **network**.

<div align="center"><img src="logo.png" /></div>

Schema of **CGeNArate container** web services. Each box in the schema is a service encapsulated into a **docker container**. The services cover the entire process from the **raw data** to the **website** analyses. See the following figure:

## Services description

### Apache / Website

The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is a **Web server** application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web:

https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd

In the same container it has been deployed the **GeNArateWeb** website: 

https://github.com/mmb-irb/CGeNArateWeb

This repository **must be cloned** in the same VM where this docker swarm is deployed and pass the absolute path to the **WEBSITE_VOLUME_PATH** variable in the [`.env`](#env-file) file.

### Workflow

TO DO

### SGE 

TO DO

### Database

The database used is **mongodb** inside a docker container:

https://github.com/docker-library/mongo

For this project, the choosen version of mongo is 6. 

Take into account that, in order to **preload databases** at the moment of deploying, a **second mongo container** named **mongo-seed**, is launched and then exited.

## Prepare configuration files

### docker-compose.yml

The [**docker-compose.yml**](./docker-compose.yml) is the file that specifies what **images** are required, what **ports** they need to expose, whether they have access to the host **filesystem**, what **commands** should be run when they start up, and so on.

```yaml
services:
  website:
    image: website_image   # name of website image
    build:
      context: ./website  # folder to search Dockerfile for this image
      args:

All the variables are defined in a `.env` file. See following section.

### .env file

⚠️ No sensible default value is provided for any of these fields, they **need to be defined** ⚠️

An `.env` file must be created in the root folder. The file [`.env.git`](./.env.git) can be taken as an example. The file must contain the following environment variables:

**Important:** the formats of **cpus** and **memory** must be in string format between single quotes. Example:

```
WEBSITE_VOLUME_PATH=/path/to/webcode  # path to web code
WEBSITE_CPU_LIMIT='2.00'  # cpus in float format
WEBSITE_MEMORY_LIMIT='2G'  # memory indicating unit (G, M)
```

The **DB_HOST** must be the name of the **stack service** followed by **underscore** and the **name of the service** as defined in the [**docker-compose.yml**](./docker-compose.yml) file (ie _my_stack_mongodb_).

The **DB_DATABASE** and **DB_AUTHSOURCE** must be the same used in the **mongo-init.js** file.

The credentials **WEBSITE_DB_LOGIN** and **WEBSITE_DB_PASSWORD** must be the same defined in the **mongo-init.js** file with the **readWrite** role.

## Build services

Check that mongodb/import.sh has exec permissions, if not:

    chmod +x mongodb/import.sh

Go to the root of the project. Then, init **Docker Swarm**:

```sh
docker swarm init
```

**Note:** when a system has **multiple network** interfaces with **different IP** addresses, Docker Swarm requires you to explicitly **specify which IP** address it should use for advertising:

```sh
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <IP_ADDRESS>
```

In order to execute the **long-term** tasks in **Docker Swarm** and the **one-off tasks**, such as the **loader** in this proof of concept, the **networks** are declared as **external** in the **docker-compose.yml** file, so they must be created before the `docker-compose build` and the `docker stack deploy`:

```sh
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable dbnet
```

> NOTE: **From July 2024 onwards**, the instruction for Docker Compose in **mac** is without hyphen, so from now on, `docker-compose build` is `docker compose build` when executing in **macOS**.

For building the services via **Docker Compose**, please execute the following instruction:

```sh
docker-compose build
```

Export environment variables defined in [**root .env file**](#env-file) and deploy docker stack:

```sh
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack
```

Check services:

```sh
$ docker stack services my_stack
ID             NAME                  MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                  PORTS   
<ID>           my_stack_mongo-seed   replicated   0/1        mongo:6                
<ID>           my_stack_mongodb      replicated   1/1        mongo:6                *:27017->27017/tcp
<ID>           my_stack_website      replicated   1/1        website_image:latest   *:8080->3001/tcp
<ID>           my_stack_workflow     replicated   0/0        workflow_image:latest
```

Check nodes:

```sh
docker node ls
```

## Execute services

### Use workflow

While the **mongodb**, **client** and **rest** containers will remain up, the **workflow** must be called every time is needed. As it is a **one-off task**, **Docker Compose** is used for running it.

Workflow **help**:

```sh
docker compose run --rm workflow
```

Or, if the above doesn't work:

```sh
docker run --rm workflow_image
```

### Check website

Open a browser and type:

```
http://localhost:8080/public/
```

## Stop services

Remove stack:

```sh
docker stack rm my_stack
```

Leave swarm:

```sh
docker swarm leave --force
```

## Tips

### Clean docker

When working with Docker, **even after removing images and containers**, Docker can leave behind various unused resources that take up **disk space**. To clean up your system effectively, you can use the following commands:

1. **Remove** unused containers, images and networks:

    Docker has a built-in command to clean up resources that are not in use:

        docker system prune

    This command will prompt you to confirm that you want to remove all unused data. If you want to avoid the prompt, you can add the -f (force) flag:

        docker system prune -f

2. **Cleaning up** the Docker builder **cache**:

    Docker build cache can also take up significant space. You can remove unused build cache:

        docker builder prune

    If you want to remove all build cache, including the cache used by the active build process:

        docker builder prune -a -f

3. Remove unused **volumes**:

    By default, docker system prune does not remove unused volumes. If you want to remove them as well, you can use:

        docker system prune --volumes

    If you want to avoid the prompt, you can add the -f (force) flag:

        docker system prune --volumes -f

4. **Check disk usage** by Docker objects

        docker system df


### Execute mongo docker in terminal mode

```sh
docker exec -it <mongo_container_ID> bash
```

And then: 

```sh
mongosh 
```

For entering the database in **terminal mode**. Take into account that, for **checking** your database and its **collections**, you must use the **authentication credentials** defined in the [**mongo-init.js**](./mongodb/mongo-init.js) file. For example, for checking the **collections** of the CGeNArate **database**, please follow the next steps:

Switch to **CGeNArate** database (or the name defined in the [**mongo-init.js**](./mongodb/mongo-init.js) file):

    use CGeNArate

**Authenticate** with one of the **users** defined in the [**mongo-init.js**](./mongodb/mongo-init.js) file:

    db.auth('user_rw','pwd_rw');

Execute some mongo shell instruction:

    show collections

Additionally, users are able to access the database as a **root/admin** user, as defined in the [**docker-compose.yml**](./docker-compose.yml) file:

    mongosh --username <ROOT_USER> --password <ROOT_PASSWORD>

Take into account that acessing mongoDB as **root/admin** user is **not recommended** as with this user there are **no restrictions** once inside the database. We strongly recommend to use the **users** defined in the [**mongo-init.js**](./mongodb/mongo-init.js) file for accessing the database.

### Apache logs

    docker logs <website_container_ID>

### Check containers

Check that the **mongo** and the replicas of **web containers** are up & running:

```sh
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                 PORTS             NAMES
<ID>           mongo:6                "docker-entrypoint.s…"   2 days ago      Up 2 days              27017/tcp         my_stack_mongodb.1.<ID>
<ID>           website_image:latest   "/app/entrypoint.sh …"   2 days ago      Up 2 days              80/tcp, 3001/tcp  my_stack_website.1.<ID>
<ID>           mongo:6                "bash /import.sh"        2 days ago      Exited (0) 2 days ago                    my_stack_mongo-seed.1.<ID>
```

Note that, as the mongo-seed container only is used in the moment of deploying, it can be removed.

### Inspect docker network 

```sh
docker network inspect dbnet
```

should show something like:

```json

                "IPv4Address": "<IP>",
                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
        "Options": {
            "com.docker.network.driver.overlay.vxlanid_list": "<ID>"
        },
        "Labels": {},
        "Peers": [
            {

                "IP": "<IP>"
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Scale a service:

Add one more replica to my_stack_website:

```sh
docker service scale my_stack_website=2
```

### Check service tasks

```sh
docker service ps my_stack_mongodb
```

### Docker stats

Check resources consumption for all running containers:

```sh
$ docker stats
CONTAINER ID   NAME                       CPU %     MEM USAGE / LIMIT   MEM %     NET I/O           BLOCK I/O         PIDS
