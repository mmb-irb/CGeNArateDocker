Persistence lengths, Tilt and Roll calculated from whole fragment and from lengths:      11 to      15
Twist calculated from whole fragment and from lengths:      11 to      15
Stretch calculated from base:       5 to base     22 and from lengths:       8 to      17
 
 A = Persistence lentgh, As = Static persistence length, Ad = Dynamic persistence length
 (a) => overall fitting
 (b) => A = As*Ad/(As+Ad)
 (c) => Ad = Tilt*Roll/(Tilt+Roll)
 (d) => A = As*Ad/(As+Ad) with Ad obtained by (c)
